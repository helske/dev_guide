A reminder of infrastructure and contact channels for maintainers of rOpenSci packages.

## GitHub repository access

You should have administrative access to your GitHub repository.
If that is no longer the case (say, the automated process failed; or you lost access after having to temporarily deactivate two-factor authentication), 
please contact us via `info@ropensci.org`.

## Other GitHub topics

If you have any GitHub question or request (adding a collaborator to the GitHub organization for instance) you can use a public channel of the rOpenSci slack workspace or ping `@ropensci/admin` on GitHub.

## pkgdown documentation

## Access to rOpenSci slack workspace
